# Python - Inheritance

In this project, I learned about Python class inheritance. I learned about the
differences between super- and sub-classes while practicing inheritance,
definining classes with multiple base classes, and overiding inherited methods
and attributes.

## Tests

* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files provided by ALX, as well as the following two independently-developed:
    * [1-my_list.txt](./1-my_list.txt)
    * [7-base_geometry.txt](./7-base_geometry.txt)

## Function Prototypes

Prototypes for functions written in this project:

| File                    | Prototype                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `0-lookup.py`           | `def lookup(obj):`                    |
| `2-is_same_class.py`    | `def is_same_class(obj, a_class):`    |
| `3-is_kind_of_class.py` | `def is_kind_of_class(obj, a_class):` |
| `4-inherits_from.py`    | `def inherits_from(obj, a_class):`    |
| `101-add_attribute.py`  | `def add_attribute(obj, att, value):` |
